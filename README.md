# Autonomous-Surveillance-Robot
This is an Autonomous Survillance Robot Project

The autonomous robot is equipped with Arduino board that further has H-Bridge
to control the motion of the robot, incremental encoders that are used to maintain the speed
and keep track of the positioning, mostly used in feedback applications. And also, integrated
with Ultrasonic Range Finder sensors in Arduino board that provide the feedback to the robot
so that it can navigate through the fields and keep itself on the path
