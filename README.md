# Autonomous-Surveillance-Robot
This is an Autonomous Survillance Robot Project

The autonomous robot is equipped with Arduino board that further has H-Bridge
to control the motion of the robot, incremental encoders that are used to maintain the speed
and keep track of the positioning, mostly used in feedback applications. And also, integrated
with Ultrasonic Range Finder sensors in Arduino board that provide the feedback to the robot
so that it can navigate through the fields and keep itself on the path

In this project, I have used Machine Learning Technique to detect Canola Leaves. This system is
detecting canola leaves instead of weeds because there are hundreds of different types of
weeds found in canola so instead of training the system to detect all sorts of weeds, it was
decided to detect canola leaves and then apply the inverse logic to ignore the canola leaves and
save the images of weeds with their location so that when the farmer is viewing these images
he will be able to identify them himself and because of this system he will know the location of
the weeds. This system will be mounted on an autonomous robot which will be able to navigate
through canola fields
